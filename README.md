# EverDrive-Packs-Lists-Database

The goal of the project is to allow users to build their own packs,
based on suggested files and folder layouts compiled by SmokeMonster
or other creators.

What is an SMDB? The SMDBs generated by the `parse_pack` script
describe an exact file and its location withing a folder
hierarchy. Each SMDB entry includes a single [SHA256
hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Hash_Algorithms) and a
folder location/file-name.

The `build_pack` script takes the SMDB information and organizes a set
of unorganized files to match an exact layout.

## Tools Included

**parse_pack.py** For making SMDBs (example command):
```DOS .bat
"C:\XXX\parse_pack.py" -f "C:\XXX\Folder to be parsed" -o "C:\XXX\SMDB.txt"
```

`-f` (or `--folder`) indicates the target ROM pack

`-o` (or `--output`) is the text file that will contain the hash
values, filenames, and folder structure


**build_pack.py** For building a pack based on a pre-made SMDB (example command):
```DOS .bat
"C:\XXX\build_pack.py" -i "C:\XXX\Folder with unorganized ROMs" -d "C:\XXX\SMDB.txt" -o "C:\XXX\Output folder for rebuilt pack" -m "C:\XXX\Missing.txt"
```

`-i` (or `--input_folder`) is the folder containing the unorganized
ROMs

`-d` (or `--database`) is the SMDB file describing the way your ROMs
are organized

`-o` (or `--output_folder`) is the folder in which to build the ROM
pack

`-m` (or `--missing`) is the text file that will list the ROMs missing
in order to reach the 100% mark

Options for advanced users:

`--file_strategy {copy,hardlink}` changes the way files are copied to
  the destination folder. The default is to physically duplicate the
  files (`copy`). The option `hardlink` avoids file duplication and
  saves storage space for pack builders. Please note that when copying
  to a FAT32 SD card, hardlinks are automatically converted into
  normal files.

`-s` (or `--skip_existing`) avoids overwriting files that already
exist in the destination folder.

Depending on your python installation, you may need to begin your
command with the location of `python.exe` (for example,
`C:\Users\XXX\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36-32\python.exe`). More
information for pack builders in the
[wiki](https://github.com/SmokeMonsterPacks/EverDrive-Packs-Lists-Database/wiki).

## Requirements

[python](https://www.python.org) 3.5 or newer

Linux, MacOS, or Windows

(Linux and MacOS users might need to convert the script and SMDB files
first with the command `dos2unix`)
