# EverDrive-Packs-Lists-Database

The goal of the project is to allow users to build their own packs,
based on suggested files and folder layouts compiled by SmokeMonster
or other users.

What is an SMDB? The SMDBs generated by the `parse_pack` script
describe an exact file and it's location withing a folder
hierarchy. Each SMDB entry includes a single [SHA256
hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Hash_Algorithms) and a
folder location/file-name.

The `build_pack` script takes the SMDB information and organizes a set
of unorganized files to match an exact layout.

## Tools Included

**parse_pack.py** For making SMDBs

*Example command*

```DOS .bat
"C:\XXX\parse_pack.py" -f "C:\XXX\Folder to be parsed" -o "C:\XXX\SMDB.txt"
```

-f indicates the target ROM pack

-o is the text file that will contain the hash values, filenames, and folder structure



**build_pack.py** For building a pack based on a pre-made SMDB

*Example command* "C:\XXX\build_pack.py" -i "C:\XXX\Folder with unorganized ROMs" -d "C:\XXX\SMDB.txt" -o "C:\XXX\Output 
folder for rebuilt pack" -m "C:\XXX\Missing.txt"

-d is the SMDB file describing the way your ROMs are organized

-o is the folder in which to build the ROM pack

-m is the text file that will list the ROMs missing in order to reach the 100% mark

* Depending on your Python installation, you may need to begin your command with the location of python.exe "C:\XXX\python.exe"
